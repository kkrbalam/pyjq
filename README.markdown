An extremely experimental and half-arsed attempt at python bindings to [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/). 

You shouldn't use these. You *might* find it enlightening to read but probably not. These are not even not production ready yet - they're outright broken.

The purpose here is more to familiarise myself with jq internals than to produce something useful. My current state of familiarity is suggesting that these will never be complete and that you're dramatically better off just running the executable in a subprocess.
